Learning Dart Basics

I've learned that Dart is the programming language used in Flutter to create fast, cross-platform apps. It powers Flutter's reactive framework, supports hot reload for instant changes, and compiles to native code for high performance. I've learned how to declare variables to different kinds of values such as numbers, strings, Booleans, lists, and many more. I've also learned what operators is, it have a different kind of symbols that used to perform arithmetic, equality, relational, type test, assignment, logical, conditional and cascade notation.

Cascade notation is a concise way to perform multiple operations on the same object, avoiding the need to repeatedly reference it. It help us to write a clean and efficient Dart code in making project in Flutter.

If we will use the external packages, libraries and classes, we used the import statement.The if, else, ternary operators, for loops, while loops, do-while loops, break, continue and switch case are all examples of control flow statements in programming that allows us to implement logic, repeat actions, or make decisions in our Flutter and Dart applications. 

I've learned that in Flutter, classes are essential for building widgets, managing state, organizing data, creating reusable components, and structuring app logic. Since widgets are implemented as classes, they are a fundamental part of every Flutter application.
