Learning Dart Basics

I've learned that Dart is the programming language used in Flutter to create fast, cross-platform apps. It powers Flutter's reactive framework, supports hot reload for instant changes, and compiles to native code for high performance. I've learned how to declare variables to different kinds of values such as numbers, strings, Booleans, lists, and many more. I've also learned what operators is, it have a different kind of symbols that used to perform arithmetic, equality, relational, type test, assignment, logical, conditional and cascade notation.

Cascade notation is a really handy feature in Dart that I learned about. It lets you perform multiple operations on the same object without having to write the object's name over and over again. This makes our code look cleaner and more efficient, especially when working on Flutter projects where we deal with a lot of widgets and configurations. For example, instead of writing multiple lines to set properties on an object, you can chain them together using the .. operator.

Another thing I learned is about the import statement. If we want to use external packages, libraries, or classes in our project, we need to include them with import. It’s like bringing in tools from outside to make our work easier or to add extra features to our app.

I also explored control flow statements in Flutter and Dart. These include things like if, else, and ternary operators for making decisions, and loops like for, while, and do-while for repeating actions. There are also switch-case statements for handling multiple conditions, and break or continue to control how loops behave. These statements are super important because they let us write logic, decide what happens in the app, and make it interactive and dynamic. It’s cool to see how all these come together to build functional applications!

I've learned that in Flutter, classes are essential for building widgets, managing state, organizing data, creating reusable components, and structuring app logic. Since widgets are implemented as classes, they are a fundamental part of every Flutter application.
